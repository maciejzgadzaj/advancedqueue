description: 'Deletes a queue item..'
help: "The <info>advancedqueue:item:delete</info> command deletes a queue item.\n\nDeletion mode depends on specific queue worker settings (\"delete.hard\" in queue worker definition), and could be either \"soft\" (deleted items will be kept in the database, just marked as processed) or \"hard\" (items will be permanently removed from the database). This setting could be overriden by using the \"--hard\" option."
arguments:
    item_id: 'ID of the item to delete. Either a single ID, or a comma-separated list.'
options:
    hard: 'Hard delete items (permanently remove them from the database) regardless of queue worker settings.'
messages:
    confirm: 'Are you sure you want to permanently delete the following items: %s?'
    item_deleted: '%s-deleted item %d from queue "%s".'
