description: 'Deletes all items from a queue.'
help: "The <info>advancedqueue:queue:delete</info> command deletes all items from a queue.\n\nDeletion mode depends on specific queue worker settings (\"delete.hard\" in queue worker definition), and could be either \"soft\" (deleted items will be kept in the database, just marked as processed) or \"hard\" (items will be permanently removed from the database). This setting could be overriden by using the \"--hard\" option.\n"
arguments:
    queues: 'Queues or queue groups to delete items from. Either a single name, a comma-separated list or "all".'
options:
    hard: 'Hard-delete items (permanently remove them from the database) regardless of queue worker settings.'
messages:
    confirm: 'Are you sure you want to permanently delete all items from the following queues: %s?'
    items_deleted: '%s-deleted %d items from queue "%s".'
