description: 'Deletes all items from a queue.'
help: |
  The <info>advancedqueue:queue:delete</info> command deletes all items from a queue.

  Deletion mode depends on specific queue worker settings (<comment>delete.hard</comment> in queue worker definition), and could be either <comment>soft</comment> (deleted items will be kept in the database, just marked as processed) or <comment>hard</comment> (items will be permanently removed from the database). This setting could be overriden by using the <info>--hard</info> option.

  <comment>Examples:</comment>
    <info>drupal aqqd all</info>                Deletes all items from all defined queues.
    <info>drupal aqqd mygroup</info>            Deletes all items from all defined queues belonging to <comment>mygroup</comment> group.
    <info>drupal aqqd mygroup1,mygroup2</info>  Deletes all items from all defined queues belonging to <comment>mygroup1</comment> or <comment>mygroup2</comment> group.
    <info>drupal aqqd all --hard</info>         Hard-deletes all items from all defined queues. The items will be permanently removed from the database, regardless of queue worker settings.
arguments:
    queues: 'Queues or queue groups to delete items from. Either a single name, a comma-separated list or <info>all</info>.'
options:
    hard: 'Hard-delete items (permanently remove them from the database) regardless of queue worker settings.'
messages:
    confirm: 'Are you sure you want to permanently delete all items from the following queues: <info>%s</info>?'
    items_deleted: '%s-deleted <info>%d</info> items from queue <info>%s</info>.'
